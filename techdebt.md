# Tech Debt

Conscious deferrals. Each entry: date, severity, context, why deferred, when to fix.

## TD-001: Magic link tokens stored in plaintext
- **Date:** 2026-04-02
- **Severity:** medium
- **Context:** The `magic_links.token` column stores the raw magic link token. If the database is compromised, unexpired tokens could be used to hijack accounts. The `sessions` table already stores hashed tokens (`token_hash`), showing the correct pattern.
- **Why deferred:** The tech design spec (section 5.1) explicitly defines `magic_links.token` as `VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE`. Task B-002 requires the schema to match the spec exactly. Changing this would be a spec deviation.
- **When to fix:** Before launch. Change `token` to `token_hash`, store SHA-256 of the token, and compare hashes during magic link validation. Update the auth implementation (B-003 or equivalent) to hash tokens before storage and comparison.

## TD-002: get_percentile edge case with zero-valued distributions
- **Date:** 2026-04-02
- **Severity:** low
- **Context:** The `get_percentile` SQL function uses `NULLIF(..., 0)` to avoid division by zero, but when a percentile bucket boundary is zero, the branch evaluates to NULL and PostgreSQL's `GREATEST`/`LEAST` ignore NULLs, potentially returning incorrect percentile values for zero-heavy metrics (e.g., tips, rewards).
- **Why deferred:** The function is copied verbatim from the tech design (section 5.2). The edge case only manifests with degenerate population data where bucket boundaries are zero, which is unlikely with real-world earnings data.
- **When to fix:** When implementing the percentiles engine (B-005 or equivalent). Add COALESCE guards around each interpolation branch to handle zero denominators gracefully.
